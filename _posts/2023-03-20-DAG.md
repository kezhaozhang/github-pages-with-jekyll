This note examines the dependence between variables in three types of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs): pipe, confounder, and collider.



## Pipe DAG

In the pipe DAG, variables X and Z are **independent** when conditioned on Y; mathematically, this can be expressed as 



$$
P(X,Z \mid Y) = P(X\mid Y) P(Z\mid Y).
$$



This can be proven using the Bayesian theorem (in steps 1 and 3 below) and Markov property of the DAG (in step 2 below): 



$$
\begin{align*} 
P(X,Z\mid Y) &= \frac{P(X,Y,Z)}{P(Y)} \\ 
&= \frac{P(Z\mid Y) P(Y\mid X) P(X)}{P(Y)}\\ 
& = P(Z\mid Y) P(X\mid Y).
\end{align*}
$$



## Confounder DAG

In the DAG with a confounder, $X$ and $Y$ are **independent** when conditioned on $Z$;  mathematically, this is



$$
P(X,Y \mid Z) = P(X\mid Z) P(Y\mid Z),
$$



which is also proved using the Bayesian theorem and Markov property of the DAG: 



$$
\begin{align*} 
P(X,Y\mid Z) &= \frac{P(X,Y,Z)}{P(Z)} \\ 
&= \frac{P(X\mid Z) P(Y\mid Z) P(Z)}{P(Z)}\\ 
& = P(X\mid Z) P(Y\mid Z). 
\end{align*}
$$



## Collider DAG

Finally, in the DAG with a collider, $X$ and $Y$ are **dependent** when conditioned on $Z$; mathematically expressed as 



$$
P(X,Y \mid Z) \neq P(X\mid Z) P(Y\mid Z).
$$



This is demonstrated by showing that $P(X,Y\mid Z)$ cannot be equal to $P(X\mid Z) P(Y\mid Z)$:



$$
\begin{align*} 
P(X,Y\mid Z) &= \frac{P(X,Y,Z)}{P(Z)} \\ 
&= \frac{P(Z\mid X) P(Z\mid Y) P(X) P(Y)}{P(Z)}\\ 
& = \frac{P(Z\mid X)P(X)}{P(Z)} \frac{P(Y\mid Z)P(Y)}{P(Z)}P(Z)\\ 
& = P(X\mid Z) P(Y\mid Z) P(Z) \\ 
& \neq P(X\mid Z) P(Y\mid Z). 
\end{align*}
$$
