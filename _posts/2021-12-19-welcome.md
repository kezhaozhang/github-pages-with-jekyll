Welcome

# Section 1

This is an $$\alpha$$ and a $\beta$

$$p(A|B) = \sum_i x_i$$

## Subsecion 
in this inaugural blog, I'd like to welcome you, my audience with the warmest heart. you'll find many intersting results from my writing.

Now we can add some math
$$ \frac{x}{\nabla y}$$

# Another Section
\begin{equation}
p(\mathrm{sequence}|T) = \left(\frac{6-T}{6}\right)^{N_G} \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^{N_E} \left(\frac{T-1}{6}\right)^{N_L},
\label{eqn_likelihood}
\end{equation}
