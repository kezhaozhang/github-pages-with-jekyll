Blogging on GitHub Pages is quick to get started. Jekyll, however, seems to require some effort to learn it well. 

The following are some of my setups for my blog.

## Editor

I use *Typora*. It has a minimalist user interface and provides a live preview on the fly. The setting is very flexible as well. One downside is its tolerance of errors in markdown or HTML statements. Sometimes pages rendered nicely in Typora didn't work well on GitHub because of errors in HTML or Markdown. Typora makes it harder to debug. 
## Latex

To render LaTeX, add the following in `_layouts/post.html` (see [this post on LaTeX in Jekyll](http://www.iangoodfellow.com/blog/jekyll/markdown/tex/2016/11/07/latex-in-markdown.html)).

```html
<script src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

 To render inline math and automatically add numbering to equation, add the following to `post.html`(see [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59141529/mathjax-equation-numbers-do-not-show-using-jekyll-on-github-pages)).

```html
<script type="text/x-mathjax-config">
 MathJax.Hub.Config({
  TeX: {
      equationNumbers: { autoNumber: "all" },
      tagSide: "right"
    },
  tex2jax: {
    inlineMath: [['$','$'], ['\\(','\\)']],
    processEscapes: true
  }

});
</script>
```

## Image

Because figure caption is not supported in Markdown HTML is used directly to include images. For example,

```html
<figure>
  <center>
    <img src='/assets/images/image.svg' height="500">
  </center>
  <figurecaption>
    <center>An exciting image.</center>
  </figurecaption>
</figure>
```
